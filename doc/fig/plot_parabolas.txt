Schematic picture to illuminate the relation between the SHO basis configuration 
used to describe densities and potentials 
compared to the SHO basis for wave functions:
If wave functions are expanded into a Hermite-Gauss basis with spread $\sigma$
up to $n\um{max}$ (here, the $n\um{max} = 5$ function is shown in blue)
the square of such a wave function leads to the function shown in purple:
A Gaussian with spread $\sigma^{[\varrho]}$ times a polynomial with max.~degree $n\um{max}^{[\varrho]}$.
This function can be exactly expanded by a Hermite-Gauss basis if
$\sqrt{2}\,\sigma^{[\varrho]} = \sigma$
and
$n\um{max}^{[\varrho]} = 2n\um{max}$.
The highest Hermite-Gauss function for $n\um{max}^{[\varrho]} = 10$ is shown in red.
The associated parabolas are shown in bold black and bold green.
In the limit of large $n\um{max}$, the classical return radius $R\um{ret}$
of both SHO bases coincides (grey dashed vertical lines).
The associated cut-off energy is $4$ times higher for the density basis.
