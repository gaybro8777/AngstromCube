    too many resources requested for launch

This is a CUDA error. It could mean that the requested total number of threads, the shared memory or the number of registers per block is too large.
Maybe you executed register-hungry CUDA kernels like green_kinetic::Laplace or green_dyadic::SHOprj/add.
Make sure that optimization levels (-O2 or -O3) are set so that the number of registers is reduced.
