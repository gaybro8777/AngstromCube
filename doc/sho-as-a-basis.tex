SHO-as-a-Basis

A full set of SHO basis functions centered on each atom leads to instabilities 
as the overlap matrix may become singular when the overlaps towards neighboring atoms are large, as e.g. in a solid.

Idea: Use large SHO bases and expand a limited set of pseudo basis functions in this basis.
The final Hamiltonian then is compact (e.g. 4 basis functions for an sp-atom)
and the large matrices from the "large" SHO basis are only needed during the sub-matrix generation.

Need: Optimization of sigma_basis for the bound pseudo waves.
      Coefficients of bound pseudo waves in that basis.
      
Q: Do we need polarization functions for e.g. the C-2s* ?
A: Simply bound states, i.e. C-2s* --> C-3s

Q: Can we take the smooth partial waves as generated by +single_atom.partial.wave.method=r (default) ?
A: Yes, but we might have to modify e.g. C-2s* --> C-3s so that all partial waves are bound states,
   so maybe we should make the basis generation as a standalone tool that exports to XML.

Example
./a43 -t single_atom -V +single_atom.fit.basis.numax=15 +single_atom.fit.basis.sigma=1.1
