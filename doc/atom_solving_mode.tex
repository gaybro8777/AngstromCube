Idea:
  A solver with radial isolated states per atom
  
  Each atom constructs the true potential
  Create radial emm-degenerate solutions of the spherical part of the potential
  Use perturbation theory to compute new emm-resolving eigenpairs of the true full potential
  Communicate the lowest part of the spectrum to a global collection array
  Solve for a new Fermi level based on this spectrum
  Use strong temperature smearing, slow mixing
  
  Should account for
    - Crystal Field Splitting
    - Charge Transfer
    - Surface Dipoles
    - Ionic Compounds/Lattices
  Does not account for
    - Covalent Bonding

  Can we solve it with the true waves alone? How do we get the projection coefficients?
  --> We do not need them, we can construct an emm-resolved synthetic density matrix

  Atom density becomes non-spherical (disregarded)
  
  
  Warn if states touch the outer radius of the radial grid!
